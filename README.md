# Screencast-setup
AppleScript that changes my screen resolution to my preferred settings and turns on 'Do Not Disturb' mode. Running the script again will toggle all the settings back. Hope it helps others like it helps me! 

## Instalation 

Open the script and find `SyncMaster` change this to the name of your screen.

Next on line `23` the script will sellect `row 4` for me this will select the `1280x800` this may differ from your setup
